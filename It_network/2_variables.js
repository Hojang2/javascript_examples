// Here I will start creating variable.
let a; // empty variable
let b = 40; // variable that contains Number 40
c = 30; // global variable
s = "Text"; // variable that contains Stirng "Text"

// Now after learning how to declare variables lets find out what we can do with them.

a = 10;
b = 20;
c = a + b;
            
document.write("Sum of two Numbers a and b:"); // Just writing some text.
document.write(c); // Printing value c after text.
document.write("<br>"); // Tag <br> is here for moving to the next row.

let s1 = "10";
let s2 = "20";
let s3 = s1 + s2; // When you sum two Strings result will be differend than sum of Numbers

document.write("Sum of two Strings s1 and s2:");
document.write(s3);
document.write("<br>");
